# UGrade 
Simple competitive programming contest platform using contestant PC as grader

## Motivation
To organize competitive programming competition we usually deploy several grader to handle contestant submissions. Sometimes the number of contestant is so huge that our grader cannot handle the submissions. Why don't we use contestant machine as grader instead?
